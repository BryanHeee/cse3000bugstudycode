Configure salt minion as:

```
master_type: failover
master:
  - 192.168.0.9
  - 192.168.0.10
```

Shutdown salt-master on 192.168.0.9.
Start salt-master on 192.168.0.10.

Run salt minion

```
# salt-minion -l debug
...

```

And it will just hang there indefinitely. Funny thing is if you hit CTRL-C, it'll unstuck it.

```

```

and it will function properly.

I'm hoping this is high priority, this completely breaks multi-master failover topology. Anyone know any workarounds?

Thanks
