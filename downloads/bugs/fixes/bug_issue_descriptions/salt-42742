### Description of Issue/Question

When providing a pki_dir in the minion configuration that does not contain a directory call 'salt' in the path, then the minion gets stuck in an infinite loop at startup.

Providing a pki_dir is important when seeding a minion through a different disk.

Problem is from `utils/verify.py` in function `win_verify_env`. The first loop. It is not hard to miss.

### Setup

Have a windows minion with the following configuration.

```
master: your_master
minion: some_name
pki_dir: c:/mypki/minion
```

And create directory "c:/mypki/minion". Add a key pair and master public key.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Start the minion, it does not go very far.

### Versions Report

Fails with 2016.11.2, 2016.11.6 and 2017.7.0

Works with 2016.3.1
